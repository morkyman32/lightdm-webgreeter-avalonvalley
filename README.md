# Features and notes
* config.js - Configuration file

# Installation (Arch Linux)
* Install `lightdm` from the official Arch repos
* Install `web-greeter` from AUR by running `yay -S web-greeter`
* Set LightDM as your default display manager and set `web-greeter` as your default greeter
* Download this repository as a .zip and extract it to a new folder named "AvalonValley"
* Copy `./AvalonValley` to `/usr/share/web-greeter/themes/`, preferably by running `sudo cp -r AvalonValley /usr/share/web-greeter/themes`

Installation should be very similar to Arch for other distros

# To-do
* The `.widget-clock` UI could be improved
* Color schemes
